# SlackBot

Building a real time messaging bot jarvis using Slack.

Here I have used outgoing webhooks to create the bot by putting my code on a free server named Heroku.

My bot responds to some keywords like Hi, Hello, Thanks.

I have also added some unique functions for jarvis.

cricscore - Shows us all the current International cricket matches going on or recently played along with a summary.

upcoming hollywood - Shows us the upcoming hollywood movies releasing after today this year along with their release dates.

railinfo - This function is in developing mode. Till now what it does is it displays the railway fare of all the classes                             of RJPB Rajdhani.
